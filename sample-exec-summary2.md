### Security Vulnerability Assessment for {{customer_name}}

A security assessment of {{images_scanned}} images currently in use at {{customer_name}} compared against Chainguard drop-in replacements found a {{reduction_percentage}} reduction in vulnerabilities. Current images contain {{total_customer_vulns}} CVEs, while Chainguard equivalents reduce this to {{total_chainguard_vulns}} .

### Key Findings

- {{images_with_reduction}} of {{images_scanned}} images show lower CVEs with Chainguard Images.
- Average per-image CVE reduction: {{average_reduction_per_image}}.
- Based on this **sample** list of images from {{customer_name}} Chainguard images reduced {{total_customer_vulns}} vulnerabilities to {{total_chainguard_vulns}}. Rolling Chainguard out to the vull {{customer_name}} environment would result in a much larger vulnerability count reduction.
- Distroless/minimal bases eliminate unnecessary components resulting in a reduced attack surface and CVES accumulating at a 90% slower rate in runtime.


### Business Impact

- Enhanced Security Posture: Partnering with Chainguard enables a {{reduction_percentage}} reduction in vulnerabilities, allowing {{customer_name}} to deliver on its CVE remediation mandate. Furthermore, all images undergo automated functional and security testing including vulnerability scans, and malware checks above and beyond what other Linux Distributions do.
- Compliance & Board Readiness: Chainguard delivers consistent, trusted open source across teams, accelerating compliance, meeting board-level goals and reducing dependency on exception workflows.
- Operational Efficiency: With {{reduction_percentage}} fewer CVEs to track, patch, and manage, offloading CVE remediation to Chainguard frees engineers from low-value triage & exception workflows, increasing focus on innovation and delivery.

### Recommendation

Adopting Chainguard images as replacements will materially reduce vulnerabilities, streamline security operations, and improve developer efficiency across the {{customer_name}} platform.
